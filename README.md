# Metasound Dattorro Reverb Implementation

### This repository is my implementation of Dattorro Reverb in Unreal Engine 5 through creation of a metasound node

Link to the paper and algorithm: https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~dattorro/EffectDesignPart1.pdf

#### The Basic Components are as follows:

- All-Pass Filter [https://thewolfsound.com/allpass-filter/] - 
- Low-Pass Filter [] -
- Delay Lines [] - 

Perhaps try to implement positions into the node for reverb
